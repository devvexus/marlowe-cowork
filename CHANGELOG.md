# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Taint gate: after a web_fetch, web_search or a read outside the workspace, web_search and web_fetch to a host not approved this session ask (`Exposure` on `Conversation`, `ToolHost::consequence_exposed`/`taints`/`egress_host`). A reloaded session recomputes it from history.
- marlowe-net refuses loopback, private, link-local and CGNAT addresses after DNS resolution.
- A workspace that is a drive root, the home directory (or above) or a system/app-data directory frees no writes; the bin no longer turns a missing workspace into the daemon's cwd, and neither `ask` nor the TUI defaults to a too-broad cwd.
- Approval modal: Deny is the default; decision keys within 400 ms of it opening are ignored; long detail scrolls, and allow is disabled until all of it has been shown. Shell summaries show `(+N lines)`.

### Fixed
- A reconnect with a replay gap gets Welcome and the gap error only (the TUI reloads); the client queue is at least `replay_ring + 2`, so a full replay always fits.
- Two concurrent loads of one session could start two runners; registration is now one locked check-and-insert.
- Idle session runners exit after `session_idle` (30 min) and reload from the store on the next ask; finished runner handles are pruned.
- `ask` and the TUI adopt only a seq-0 `SessionOpened`, never another client's broadcast or `TurnStarted`.
- web_fetch honours interrupt and has a 60 s total deadline.
- OpenRouter: parallel tool calls streamed at one index with distinct ids stay separate calls.

## M1 Walking skeleton — integration — 2026-10-09

### Added
- New crates: `marlowe-model` (provider seam), `marlowe-proto` (client/daemon wire), `marlowe-agent` (lean loop), `marlowe-brains` (model library, slots, credentials), `marlowe-daemon` (actor daemon, numbered bus with replay, sqlite sessions), `marlowe-tui` (Conversation + Situation Board client).
- `marlowe` bin: `daemon`, `ask [--model] [--workspace] [--session] [--yes]`, `models list|detect|catalog|add|remove|slot`, `sessions [limit]`, `status`, `shutdown`, `doctor`; auto-spawns a detached daemon.

### Changed
- `marlowe-provider`, `-openrouter`, `-exec` and the bin ported onto `marlowe-model`; workspace `exclude = ["legacy"]`, transitional legacy members removed.
- `scripts/cargo-idle.ps1` passes arguments through verbatim (`-p` and `--` work).

### Fixed
- Daemon dropped every client that sent nothing for 10 s (hello timeout left on the cloned read socket).
- `LineReader` lost a partial line when a read timed out mid-line; it now resumes.
- A daemon spawned from a pipeline held the caller's stdout open, hanging `marlowe ... | x` and redirects.
- CLI library mutations (and `ask --model`) raced the daemon's worker thread; they now wait for the broadcast `LibraryState`.
- `ask` workspaces kept the `\\?\` verbatim prefix; a new session now defaults to the current directory.
- Reasoning token counts are per delta: the TUI and CLI sum them, and a late settlement updates the thinking line.

### Verified
- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean (only pre-existing test-name lints in `marlowe-memory`); `cargo test --workspace`: all pass.
- Live: OpenRouter catalog (469 models), `models add`, `ask` with a tool call, restart after `taskkill /F` with the session intact.

## M0 Foundation — 2026-10-09

### Added
- New workspace with the crates inherited from Marlowe_Harness (baseline commit `962e6fe`, a verbatim copy).
- `legacy/` holding `marlowe-loop`, `marlowe-daemon` and `marlowe-stub` as reference only — not workspace members, not usable as dependencies.
- Persona v3 (`persona/v3.md`): v2 plus a JARVIS layer — address rules ("sir" in greetings, briefings and alerts), graduate-level `<rigour>`, anticipation, dry wit in low-stakes moments, automatic memory with contradiction asides and provenance answers.
- Persona capability blocks (`persona/blocks/briefing.md`, `crew.md`, `voice.md`), appended only when the capability is live, so the prompt never leads the harness.
- `scripts/fetch-models.ps1` (copies the two pinned models from Marlowe_Harness, or the embedder from Hugging Face, and verifies sha256) and `scripts/cargo-idle.ps1` (cargo at idle priority).
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/VISION.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Changed
- `ort` no longer enables CUDA: `download-binaries` only, pinned `=2.0.0-rc.10`. Embedder and cross-encoder are CPU-only; the shipped retrieval numerics are unchanged (reference fixture tests green).
- Workspace members: `marlowe-contract`, `-journal`, `-memory`, `-net`, `-extract`, `-tools`, `-permission`, `-mcp`, `-view`, `-surface`. Parked until M1: `marlowe-provider`, `-openrouter`, `-exec`, `marlowe` (bin).
- `marlowe-tools`: `MAX_EXPOSED_TOOLS` 14 → 64.
- CI rewritten for the new workspace; the traversal-suite accounting check is kept.

### Removed
- `marlowe-memory`: CUDA/VRAM/host-memory probing (`cue/dense/{cuda_libs,vram,hostmem}.rs`), provider-choice plumbing, the unwired GPU rerank cascade (`RerankPlan`, `Rerank::Cascade`, fusion graphs), the fit-only `Scoring::FitDump` path, gate artifacts v1–v4, examples, and device-only tests. `select_for_injection(_probed)`, the gate, the operating point and consolidation are unchanged.
- `marlowe-contract` / `marlowe-view`: the escalation vocabulary of the abandoned agent hierarchy.
- `marlowe-surface`: the old app/window/render/commands/cli/inspector/escalation modules and their tests. Kept: theme, markdown, latex, meter, region, chrome, keys, clipboard, overlay, doctor; `amplitude` and `frame_clock` moved in from the stub.
- `marlowe-permission/tests/boundary_hook.rs`, which tested the old repo's Claude Code edit-guard hook (`.claude/hooks/protect-boundaries.py`) that was not carried over. The path-scope security suites (`traversal.rs`, `toctou.rs`) are kept and green.

### Verified
- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo test --workspace`: 654 passed, 0 failed, including `embedding_reference` and `cross_encoder_reference` against the real pinned models on CPU.
